Description: The package implements Bayesian inference for four models: (1) BFLM, a binary model based on generalized functional linear models (GFLM), (2) SBFLM, a binary spatial model based on spatial GFLM, (3) BFLMM, a binary mixed model based on GFLM, and (4) SBFLMM, spatial binary functional linear mixed model.
